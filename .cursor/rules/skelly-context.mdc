description: Use Skelly CLI for code navigation
alwaysApply: true

Run skelly doctor first. If context is stale, run skelly update.
Use .skelly/skills/skelly.md and CONTEXT.md as primary guidance.
Prefer Skelly CLI commands (symbol/callers/callees/trace/path/status) for navigation and impact analysis.
Avoid direct reads of .skelly/.context/* unless debugging or CLI output is insufficient.
